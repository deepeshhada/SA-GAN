# Generative Adversarial Networks: Deep Convolutional and Self Attention GANs

## Task
In this project, we use the CIFAR-10 dataset to train the Generator and the Discriminator to generate new images which resemble the images from the dataset.

## Motivation
GANs are infamous for their notoreity in training. The discriminator usually learns much faster than the generator, and the generator lags behind. A stable training for GANs was suggested in the Deep Convolutional GAN (DC-GAN) paper.
We Ô¨Årst look at the implementation of the DC-GAN, its limitations, and see how they are overcome by SA-GANs and Wasserstein distance. 

The academic report contains all the implementation details thoroughly.
